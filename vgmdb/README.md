# VGMdb cddb script

Built when I was still active on VGMdb as a volunteer project.

Converts an album record stored on the site's MySQL database into a
faux CDDB/freedb file allowing users to send requests to VGMdb like
it was a real CDDB/freedb server.

Also included the abilty to grab the site's tracklist data in different
languages, when present, by including the language in the url. This
option is not present in the official CDDB server protocols and was
uniquely built for the site only.

There's still a bit that could have been done to this such as handling
mixed session data discs correctly and track-by-track artist credits.

Handed over to the staff and largely forgotten. Site's development has
stagnated from what I've seen and I lost interest there after their
divisive, in my opinion, decision to include anime and general animation
albums.
