# SDLua

Lua wrapper package created for my final university project.
A more Lua-ish interface over SDL. Abandoned after the release of
the Love2D game engine which covers much of the same functionality.

## Dependencies

Lua 5.1
SDL 1.2.9
SDL_mixer 1.2.7

Optional (loaded at runtime if present)

SDL_image 1.2.5
SDL_ttf 2.0.8
